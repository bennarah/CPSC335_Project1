This program solves the Alternating Discs Problem.

It takes a list of 2n discs, alternating between light ('L') and dark ('D'),  
and sorts them so that all light discs are on the left and all dark discs are on the right.  
It uses only adjacent swaps and counts how many swaps are made.

## How to Run

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run the file with:

```bash
python3 alternating_disc.py
